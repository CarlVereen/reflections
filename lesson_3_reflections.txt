When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote, when sharing with friends or partners a coding file 
that we are all working on, or when I want to work with a file anywhere at anytime. 
Also for my professional portfolio. There may be other reasons but these are the 
first that come to mind

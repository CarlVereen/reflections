When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
***

I would want to use a remote, when sharing with friends or partners a coding file 
that we are all working on, or when I want to work with a file anywhere at anytime. 
Also for my professional portfolio. There may be other reasons but these are the 
first that come to mind

***
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
***

manually pulling allows me the ability to review the changes and only pull when I 
am ready to have the repository match. automatic pulls may override changes that I 
have made locally when that is not something I want to happen.

***
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
***

forks are copies of repositories on gitHub that point back to the parent repository
. Much like a version branch of a git repository. Clones are copies of a 
repository that are stored locally on your system. and branches are different a 
way to save and review files that are similar but not the same as the master file 
without replacing the master fully. It allows you to work on both the master and 
the branch file without affecting eachother.

***
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
***

being able to work offline (with the lastest files or to resolve merge conflicts) or maintain a branch that you may not be ready to share on the repository.

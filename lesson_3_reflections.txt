When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
***

I would want to use a remote, when sharing with friends or partners a coding file 
that we are all working on, or when I want to work with a file anywhere at anytime. 
Also for my professional portfolio. There may be other reasons but these are the 
first that come to mind

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
***

manually pulling allows me the ability to review the changes and only pull when I 
am ready to have the repository match. automatic pulls may override changes that I 
have made locally when that is not something I want to happen.

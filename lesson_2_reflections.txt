What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
***

Initializing a repository starts the version control that git offers. It setups all
the initial parts of the git process. You need to start somewhere and you cannot 
start without initializing or mentioning the beginning.

***
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
***

The staging area is a holding / planning stop point between the working directory 
and the repository. It offers a great way for you to ensure you have all the right 
pieces for your commit and allows one last check before saving to the repository. 
Additionally with multi-files it provides a way to not have to save each file 
seperately.

***
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
***

You can review what is in the staging area. This can be done throught the git status 
command, or for greater review either the git diff or the git diff --staging. These 
last two commands let you review the changes made to the file(S) found in the 
staging area.

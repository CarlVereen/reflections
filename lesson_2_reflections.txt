What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
***

Initializing a repository starts the version control that git offers. It setups all
the initial parts of the git process. You need to start somewhere and you cannot 
start without initializing or mentioning the beginning.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
***

The staging area is a holding / planning stop point between the working directory 
and the repository. It offers a great way for you to ensure you have all the right 
pieces for your commit and allows one last check before saving to the repository. 
Additionally with multi-files it provides a way to not have to save each file 
seperately.
